# Just Tech News
## Description
With technology changing at a rapid pace, it can be hard to stay up to date with the latest technological advancements and trends. Luckily though, there is a solution: a Reddit-like app where you can upvote and comment on the latest technology news. Introducing Just Tech News, made entirely in the Python programming language!
### Why did I make this?
I wanted to practice using Python for web development. More specifically, I wanted to learn how you can use the Flask framework to pull this off in Python.
### What problem does this solve?
New technologies are created seemingly every day in this time and age, so it makes sense that many tech businesses and tech geeks would want some kind of website where they can share news on brand new technologies, or share their thoughts on new technological developments.
### What did I learn?
I learned about the similarities and differences between JavaScript and Python (for just one example, Python uses `try...except` statements rather than `try...catch` statements). I also learned how to install different Python dependancies using the PIP package manager. Finally, I learned how to import different models and files to make sure my Flask application functions correctly.
